## TWC_VALIDATION ##

The purpose of the TWC_VALIDATION code is to provide an objective evaluation of the _sameness_ ofthe output from different MPAS simulations. With this validation test, we expect that the results should be nearly identical.

#### Example Uses for this Code ####

   - Comparing the same code run with different compilers
   - Comparing the same code run with different optimzation levels of the same compiler

   - Comparing the same code run with different hardware

#### Incorrect Uses for this Code ####

   - Comparing different physics schemes
   - Comparing different dynamics options
   - Comparing different meshes
   - Comparing different horizontal or vertical resolution
